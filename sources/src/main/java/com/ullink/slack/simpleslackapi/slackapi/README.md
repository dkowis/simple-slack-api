# TODO List

* [ ] Jackson-based marshaller for RTM events w/tests
* [ ] Custom marshalling for timestamps
* [ ] Delete the GSON based marshallers


## Step Two TODOs
* [ ] Custom marshalling for Slack channels and Slack Users
    * look up the user ID and the channel ID, and fully resolve them into objects
    * It'd be super cool to be able to do that, but need to degrade gracefully as well
